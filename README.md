Tic Tac Toe in React
====================

**React project designed for [Code Nation][code-nation] students**

This is a single-client version of the [studio-multiplayer-game] taught in
previous school years. This time students are expected to create their own game
from scratch without the use of Firebase like before. All gameplay will be done
locally from a single machine.

This repository serves as an example project with a class-by-class walk through
described in subsequent sections.
